# Containerized-Application-Deployment on AWS ECS

This project demonstrates a complete, automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a containerized **Node.js web application** to **AWS ECS Fargate**.  
The entire infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)**, and deployments are automated using **GitHub Actions**.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Diagram

The architecture is designed for automation, scalability, and security.  
When a developer pushes code to the main branch on GitHub, a CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically.  
This pipeline builds a new Docker image, pushes it to a private container registry (ECR), and deploys the new version to the ECS cluster without any manual intervention.  
An Application Load Balancer manages and routes public traffic to the healthy containers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Code Push:**  
   A developer pushes code changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository.

2. **CI/CD Trigger:**  
   The push triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.

3. **Build & Push:**  
   The workflow builds the application into a Docker image and pushes the new image to a private Amazon ECR repository.

4. **Deploy:**  
   The workflow updates the ECS service with a new task definition pointing to the newly uploaded image.

5. **Service Update:**  
   ECS Fargate performs a rolling deployment, draining old connections and starting a new container with the updated image to ensure zero downtime.

6. **Traffic Serving:**  
   The Application Load Balancer (ALB) automatically routes traffic to the new, healthy container.

7. **Monitoring:**  
   Application logs are streamed directly to AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and debugging.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Justification

| Component           | Technology        | Justification |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Cloud Provider      | AWS              | Chosen for its robust and mature ecosystem for cloud-native applications, extensive documentation, and the availability of a generous free tier for key services. |
| IaC (Infrastructure as Code) | Terraform | Preferred over CloudFormation for its cloud-agnostic nature, simpler syntax (HCL), and strong state management capabilities, making infrastructure reproducible and easy to manage. |
| Containerization    | Docker           | The industry standard for containerization. It allows packaging the application and its dependencies into a lightweight, portable container that runs consistently everywhere. |
| Orchestration       | AWS ECS on Fargate | Selected for its simplicity and serverless nature. Fargate removes the operational overhead of managing EC2 instances, allowing us to focus solely on the application. |
| CI/CD Automation    | GitHub Actions    | Chosen for its seamless integration with the source code repository. It provides a powerful, event-driven automation platform directly within the development workflow. |
| Application         | Node.js (Express) | A lightweight and efficient framework, ideal for building a simple web application. Its non-blocking I/O makes it suitable for containerized microservices. |
| Logging / Monitoring | AWS CloudWatch  | The native AWS solution for logging and monitoring. It integrates automatically with ECS, providing an easy way to collect, view, and analyze application logs without extra setup. |

4Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger the Deployment:

Make a small change in the application code (e.g., edit text in /app/welcome.ejs).

git add .
git commit -m "Triggering deployment"
git push origin main


The deployment will start automatically.

Monitor progress under the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
